## Description

Does this alphabet soup make sense to you: AES, HMAC, ECDSA, RSA, SHA512, CA, PKCS8
Even if it doesn’t, you are using these on a day-to-day basis in securing your information!

We are pleased to announce our next webinar in collaboration with ThoughtWorks on “Everyday Cryptography to secure your applications using Open Source tools”.

In this talk, we will be exploring the constructs of cryptographic techniques. We will touch upon the importance of the above-mentioned algorithms, along with a live demo of the supporting tools.

### Key Takeaways

* Learn about cryptographic pieces.
* Learn to differentiate encoding, encryption & hashing, and when to apply each technique.
* Hear from experts about algorithms that helps secure your data during transmission.
* Learn about Digital signatures and why they always accompany encryption.
